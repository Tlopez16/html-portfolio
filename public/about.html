<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello! I'm Tolu Adekoya, a passionate and dedicated pharmacist currently working at an NHS Trust. I completed my pharmacy degree at the University of Reading, where I spent four years immersed in the fascinating world of pharmaceuticals and healthcare. In my role as a hospital pharmacist, I am committed to providing the best possible care for my patients. I find great satisfaction in knowing that my work directly contributes to their well-being and recovery. The dynamic environment of a hospital keeps me on my toes, constantly learning and adapting to new challenges.</p>
    
  <p>Outside of my professional life, I have a keen interest in Korean dramas. There's something about the storytelling and cultural insights that captivate me. Additionally, I'm on a journey to rekindle my love for reading. There's nothing quite like getting lost in a good book and the myriad worlds they open up. </p>
    
  <p>I have an innate curiosity and a love for learning new things. However, I must admit, I sometimes struggle with perseverance if I don't grasp something immediately. It's a personal trait I'm working on, as I believe in the importance of resilience and continuous improvement. </p>
    
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I'm excited about the future and the endless possibilities for growth, both personally and professionally.</p>
