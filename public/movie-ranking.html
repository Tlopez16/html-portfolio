<h1>The Best Korean Dramas According to Tolu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 k-dramas of all time!</h2>

<hr/>
<h2>In no particular order:</h2>
<h3>Alchemy of souls</h3>
<p>Great drama! A supernatural k-drama that focuses on use of magic, also has a love story and a plot twist! Loved it!</p>

<h3>Penthouse</h3>
<p>Absolutely loved it! This is a 3 part series k-drama which you either love or you hate. It is called a makjang because of its outrageous storylines. Its a story about wealth, the educational system, cheating, murder, bullying and many more! You just need to watch it.</p>

<h3>Run on</h3>
<p>If you're looking for a romantic drama where the main leads actually communicates, this is it! No room for miscommunication because they know how to speak to each other. Highly recommend. When you watch the likes of flower of evil, tunnel, penthouse, you need something lighthearted that would just get you in the feels. This is it!</p>
